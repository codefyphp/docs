## <p style="text-align: center;">What Is CodefyPHP?</p>

CodefyPHP is a simple framework providing contracts and abstractions for architecting a Domain Driven project with 
Event Sourcing. Codefy is not a full fledge framework such as the likes of Symfony Laravel, Codeigniter or CakePHP. 
Its main purpose is to ease the development of complex domains, but you can utilize it anyway that works for you. 
Although it is not feature rich, it contains the needed essentials to get you started creating quick projects: [routing](https://codefyphp.com/knowledgebase/routing/), 
templating, [scheduling](https://codefyphp.com/knowledgebase/scheduler/), logging, security, 
[Dbal](https://codefyphp.com/knowledgebase/database-abstraction-layer-dbal/) and [migrations](https://codefyphp.com/knowledgebase/migrations/).
