<p style="text-align: center;">What Is CodefyPHP?</p>
=====================================================

First, let's unpack the name Codefy and what it means. The name Codefy is a derivative of the word `codify` which means 
to arrange into a systematic code according to a plan or system. This is the purpose of CodefyPHP as it pertains 
to Domain-Driven Design, ubiquitous language, and complex applications.

Therefore, the CodefyPHP is a simple framework providing contracts and abstractions for architecting a Domain Driven 
project with Event Sourcing. Codefy is not a full stack framework such as the likes of Symfony Laravel, Codeigniter or 
CakePHP. Its main purpose is to ease the development of complex domains, but you can utilize it anyway that works for you. 
Although it is not feature rich, it contains the needed essentials to get you started creating quick projects: [routing](https://codefyphp.com/knowledgebase/routing/), 
templating, [scheduling](https://codefyphp.com/knowledgebase/scheduler/), logging, security,
