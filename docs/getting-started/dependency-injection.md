## Installation

```shell
composer require qubus/injector
```

## Introduction

The framework uses [Qubus/Injector](https://github.com/QubusPHP/injector) which recursively instantiates class dependencies based on the parameter type-hints
specified in class constructor signatures. This requires the use of Reflection. You may have heard that
"reflection is slow". Let's clear something up: anything can be "slow" if you're doing it wrong. Reflection is an order
of magnitude faster than disk access and several orders of magnitude faster than retrieving information (for example)
from a remote database. Additionally, each reflection offers the opportunity to cache the results if you're worried
about speed. The Injector caches any reflections it generates to minimize the potential performance impact.

## Basic Usage

To start using the injector, simply create a new instance of the `Qubus\Injector\Injector` ("the Injector") class:

    <?php
    
    $injector = new Qubus\Injector\Injector(
        Qubus\Injector\Config\InjectorFactory::create([])
    );

### Basic Instantiation

If a class doesn't specify any dependencies in its constructor signature there's little point in using the Injector to
generate it. However, for the sake of completeness, consider that you can do the following with equivalent results:

    <?php
    
    $injector = new Qubus\Injector\Injector(
        Qubus\Injector\Config\InjectorFactory::create([])
    );

    $obj1 = new App\MyClass;
    $obj2 = $injector->make('App\MyClass');
    
    var_dump($obj2 instanceof App\MyClass); // true

#### Concrete Type-hinted Dependencies

If a class only asks for concrete dependencies, you can use the Injector to inject them without specifying any
injection definitions. For example, in the following scenario you can use the Injector to automatically provision
`MyClass` with the required `SomeDependency` and `AnotherDependency` class instances:

    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    class SomeDependency {}
    
    class AnotherDependency {}
    
    class MyClass {
        public $dep1;
        public $dep2;
        public function __construct(SomeDependency $dep1, AnotherDependency $dep2) {
            $this->dep1 = $dep1;
            $this->dep2 = $dep2;
        }
    }
    
    $injector = new Qubus\Injector\Injector(
        Qubus\Injector\Config\InjectorFactory::create([])
    );

    $myObj = $injector->make('MyClass');
    
    var_dump($myObj->dep1 instanceof SomeDependency); // true
    var_dump($myObj->dep2 instanceof AnotherDependency); // true

#### Recursive Dependency Instantiation

One of the Injector's key attributes is that it recursively traverses class dependency trees to instantiate objects.
This is just a fancy way of saying, "if you instantiate object A which asks for object B, the Injector will instantiate
any of object B's dependencies so that B can be instantiated and provided to A". This is perhaps best understood with a
simple example. Consider the following classes in which a `Car` asks for `Engine` and the `Engine` class has concrete
dependencies of its own:

    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    class Car {
        private $engine;
        public function __construct(Engine $engine) {
            $this->engine = $engine;
        }
    }
    
    class Engine {
        private $sparkPlug;
        private $piston;
        public function __construct(SparkPlug $sparkPlug, Piston $piston) {
            $this->sparkPlug = $sparkPlug;
            $this->piston = $piston;
        }
    }
    
    $injector = new Qubus\Injector\Injector(
        Qubus\Injector\Config\InjectorFactory::create([])
    );

    $car = $injector->make('Car');
    var_dump($car instanceof Car); // true

## App-Bootstrapping

DICs should be used to wire together the disparate objects of your application into a cohesive functional unit 
(generally at the bootstrap or front-controller stage of the application). One such usage provides an elegant solution 
for one of the thorny problems in object-oriented (OO) web applications: how to instantiate classes in a routed 
environment where the dependencies are not known ahead of time. The CodefyPHP framework supplies a solution to the 
problem in the form of Service Providers.

## Service Providers

To make it easier to use the `Injector/Container/ServiceContainer`, the framework can be bootstrapped with
`ServiceProviders`.

Service providers are used to bootstrap your application with the injection of core classes and dependencies.

A service provider will have one or two methods: `register()` and/or `boot()`. The register method should only be used
to define parameters, define new services or extend services.

The boot method is called after all service providers have been registered.

From here on, all the examples will show how to use Service Providers to inject your dependencies throughout the entire
application. `Codefy\Framework\Application` is the main part of the framework, and it extends the Injector. In the
Service Providers, we call `Codefy\Framework\Application` by using `$this->codefy`.

### Registering Service Providers

You can register service providers via `bootstrap/providers.php`:

```php title="./bootstrap/providers.php"
<?php

return [
    App\Infrastructure\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
];
```

Or you can register service providers via `config/app.php` using the `providers` key:

```php title="./config/app.php"
<?php

'providers' => Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider::defaultProviders()->merge([

    // Application Service Providers...
    App\Infrastructure\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    
])->toArray(),
```

### Injection Definitions

You may have noticed that the previous examples all demonstrated instantiation of classes with explicit, type-hinted,
concrete constructor parameters. Obviously, many of your classes won't fit this mold. Some classes will type-hint
interfaces and abstract classes. Some will specify scalar parameters which offer no possibility of type-hinting in PHP.
Still other parameters will be arrays, etc. In such cases we need to assist the Injector by telling it exactly what we
want to inject.

#### Defining Class Names for Constructor Parameters

Let's look at how to provision a class with non-concrete type-hints in its constructor signature. Consider the
following code in which a `Car` needs an `Engine` and `Engine` is an interface:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    interface Engine {}
    
    class V8 implements Engine {}
    
    class Car {
        private $engine;
        public function __construct(Engine $engine) {
            $this->engine = $engine;
        }
    }

To instantiate a `Car` in this case, we simply need to define an injection definition for the class ahead of time:

```php title="File: ./app/Infrastructure/Providers/ExampleServiceProvider.php"
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;

use Car;
use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
use V8;

final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->codefy->define(Car::class, ['engine' => V8::class]);
    }
}
```
```php title="Test Car Instance"
<?php

// test it works
$car = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(Car::class);
var_dump($car instanceof Car); // true
```


The most important points to notice here are:

1. A custom definition is an array whose keys match constructor parameter names
2. The values in the definition array represent the class names to inject for the specified parameter key

Because the `Car` constructor parameter we needed to define was named `$engine`, our definition specified an `engine`
key whose value was the name of the class (`V8`) that we want to inject.

Custom injection definitions are only necessary on a per-parameter basis. For example, in the following class, we only
need to define the injectable class for `$arg2` because `$arg1` specifies a concrete class type-hint:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    class MyClass {
        private $arg1;
        private $arg2;
        public function __construct(SomeConcreteClass $arg1, SomeInterface $arg2) {
            $this->arg1 = $arg1;
            $this->arg2 = $arg2;
        }
    }
    
    
    
    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;
    
    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use MyClass;
    use SomeImplementationClass;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            $this->codefy->define(MyClass::class, ['arg2' => SomeImplementationClass::class]);
        }
    }

!!! info "Info:" 
    Injecting instances where an abstract class is type-hinted works in exactly the same way as the above examples for 
    interface type-hints.

#### Using Existing Instances in Injection Definitions

Injection definitions may also specify a pre-existing instance of the requisite class instead of the string class name:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    interface SomeInterface {}
    
    class SomeImplementation implements SomeInterface {}
    
    class MyClass {
        private $dependency;
        public function __construct(SomeInterface $dependency) {
            $this->dependency = $dependency;
        }
    }
    
    
    
    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;
    
    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use MyClass;
    use SomeImplementation;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            $dependencyInstance = new SomeImplementation;
            $this->codefy->define(MyClass::class, [':dependency' => $dependencyInstance]);
        }
    }
    
    <?php
    
    // test it works
    $myObj = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(MyClass::class);
    var_dump($myObj instanceof MyClass); // true

!!! info "Info:" 
    Since the `define()` call is passing raw values (as evidenced by the colon `:` usage), you can achieve the same result 
    by omitting the array key(s) and relying on parameter order rather than name. Like so: 
    `$this->codefy->define(MyClass::class, [$dependencyInstance]);`.


#### Specifying Injection Definitions On the Fly

You may also specify injection definitions at call-time with `Qubus\Injector\Injector::make`. Consider:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    interface SomeInterface {}
    
    class SomeImplementationClass implements SomeInterface {}
    
    class MyClass {
        private $dependency;
        public function __construct(SomeInterface $dependency) {
            $this->dependency = $dependency;
        }
    }
    
    $myObj = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(MyClass::class, ['dependency' => SomeImplementationClass::class]);
    var_dump($myObj instanceof MyClass); // true

The above code shows how even though we haven't called the Injector's `define` method, the call-time specification 
allows us to instantiate `MyClass`.

!!! note "Note:"
    On-the-fly instantiation definitions will override a pre-defined definition for the specified class, but only in the 
    context of that particular call to `Qubus\Injector\Injector::make`.

### Type-Hint Aliasing

Programming to interfaces is one of the most useful concepts in object-oriented design (OOD), and well-designed code 
should type-hint interfaces whenever possible. But does this mean we have to assign injection definitions for every 
class in our application to reap the benefits of abstracted dependencies? Thankfully the answer to this question is, 
"NO." The Injector accommodates this goal by accepting "aliases". Consider:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    interface Engine {}
    
    class V8 implements Engine {}
    
    class Car {
        private $engine;
        public function __construct(Engine $engine) {
            $this->engine = $engine;
        }
    }



    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;

    use Car;
    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use Engine;
    use V8;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            // Tell the Injector class to inject an instance of V8 any time
            // it encounters an Engine type-hint
            $this->codefy->alias(Engine::class, V8::class);
        }
    }

    // test it works
    $car = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(Car::class);
    var_dump($car instanceof Car); // true

In this example we've demonstrated how to specify an alias class for any occurrence of a particular interface or 
abstract class type-hint. Once an implementation is assigned, the Injector will use it to provision any parameter 
with a matching type-hint.

!!! note "Note:"
    If an injection definition is defined for a parameter covered by an implementation assignment, the definition takes 
    precedence over the implementation.

### Non-Class Parameters

All the previous examples have demonstrated how the Injector class instantiates parameters based on type-hints, 
class name definitions and existing instances. But what happens if we want to inject a scalar or other non-object 
variable into a class? First, let's establish the following behavioral rule:

!!! note "Note:"
    The Injector assumes all named-parameter definitions are class names by default.

If you want the Injector to treat a named-parameter definition as a "raw" value and not a class name, you must prefix 
the parameter name in your definition with a colon character `:`. For example, consider the following code in which we 
tell the Injector to share a `PDO` database connection instance and define its scalar constructor parameters:

    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;

    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use PDO;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            $this->codefy->share(PDO::class);

            $this->codefy->define(PDO::class, [
                ':dsn' => 'mysql:dbname=testdb;host=127.0.0.1',
                ':username' => 'dbuser',
                ':password' => 'dbpass'
            ]);
        }
    }

The colon character preceding the parameter names tells the Injector that the associated values ARE NOT class names. 
If the colons had been omitted above, Qubus Injector would attempt to instantiate classes of the names specified in the 
string and an exception would result. Also, note that we could just as easily specified arrays or integers or any other 
data type in the above definitions. As long as the parameter name is prefixed with a `:`, Qubus Injector will inject the 
value directly without attempting to instantiate it.

!!! info "Info:"
    As mentioned previously, since the `define()` call is passing raw values, you may opt to assign the values by 
    parameter order rather than name. Since PDO's first three parameters are `$dsn`, `$username`, and `$password`, 
    in that order, you could accomplish the same result by leaving out the array keys, 
    like so: `$this->codefy->define(PDO::class, ['mysql:dbname=testdb;host=127.0.0.1', 'dbuser', 'dbpass']);`.

### Global Parameter Definitions

Sometimes applications may reuse the same value everywhere. However, it can be a hassle to manually specify definitions 
for this sort of thing everywhere it might be used in the app. Qubus Injector mitigates this problem by exposing the 
`defineParam()` method. Consider the following example:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    class MyClass {
        public $myValue;
        public function __construct($myValue) {
            $this->myValue = $myValue;
        }
    }



    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;

    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use MyClass;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            $myUniversalValue = 42;

            $this->codefy->defineParam('myValue', $myUniversalValue);
        }
    }

    // test it works
    $obj = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(MyClass::class);
    var_dump($obj->myValue === 42); // bool(true)

Because we specified a global definition for `myValue`, all parameters that are not in some other way defined 
(as below) that match the specified parameter name are autofilled with the global value. If a parameter matches any of 
the following criteria the global value is not used:

* A typehint
* A predefined injection definition
* A custom call time definition

### Advanced Usage

#### Instance Sharing

One of the more ubiquitous plagues in modern OOP is the Singleton anti-pattern. Coders looking to limit classes to a 
single instance often fall into the trap of using static Singleton implementations for things like configuration 
classes and database connections. While it's often necessary to prevent multiple instances of a class, the Singleton 
method spells death to testability and should generally be avoided. `Qubus\Injector\Injector` makes sharing class 
instances across contexts a triviality while allowing maximum testability and API transparency.

Let's consider how a typical problem facing object-oriented web applications is easily solved by wiring together your 
application using the Injector. Here, we want to inject a single database connection instance across multiple layers of 
an application. We have a controller class that asks for a `DataMapper` that requires a `PDO` database connection instance:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    class DataMapper {
        private $pdo;
        public function __construct(PDO $pdo) {
            $this->pdo = $pdo;
        }
    }
    
    class MyController {
        private $mapper;
        public function __construct(DataMapper $mapper) {
            $this->mapper = $mapper;
        }
    }



    <?php

    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;
    
    declare(strict_types=1);

    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use PDO;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            $db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydb', 'user', 'pass');

            $this->codefy->share($db);
        }
    }

In the above code, the `DataMapper` instance will be provisioned with the same `PDO` database connection instance we 
originally shared. This example is contrived and overly simple, but the implication should be clear:

!!! info "Info:"
    By sharing an instance of a class, `Qubus\Injector\Injector` will always use that instance when provisioning classes 
    that type-hint the shared class.

#### A Simpler Example

Let's look at a simple proof of concept:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);

    class Person {
        public $name = 'John Snow';
    }



    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;

    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use Person;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            $this->codefy->share(Person::class);
        }
    }

    // test it out
    $person = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(Person::class);
    var_dump($person->name); // John Snow

    $person->name = 'Arya Stark';

    $anotherPerson = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(Person::class);
    var_dump($anotherPerson->name); // Arya Stark
    var_dump($person === $anotherPerson); // bool(true) because it's the same instance!

Defining an object as shared will store the provisioned instance in the Injector's shared cache and all future requests 
to the provider for an injected instance of that class will return the originally created object. Note that in the 
above code, we shared the class name (`Person`) instead of an actual instance. Sharing works with either a class name or 
an instance of a class. The difference is that when you specify a class name, the Injector will cache the shared 
instance the first time it is asked to create it.

!!! note "Note:"
    Once the Injector caches a shared instance, call-time definitions passed to `Qubus\Injector\Injector::make` will have 
    no effect. Once shared, an instance will always be returned for instantiations of its type until the object is 
    un-shared or refreshed:

### Instantiation Delegates

Often factory classes/methods are used to prepare an object for use after instantiation. The Injector allows you to 
integrate factories and builders directly into the injection process by specifying callable instantiation delegates on 
a per-class basis. Let's look at a very basic example to demonstrate the concept of injection delegates:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    class MyComplexClass {
        public $verification = false;
        public function doSomethingAfterInstantiation() {
            $this->verification = true;
        }
    }



    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;

    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use MyComplexClass;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {

            $complexClassFactory = function() {
                $obj = new MyComplexClass();
                $obj->doSomethingAfterInstantiation();
    
                return $obj;
            };

            $this->codefy->delegate(MyComplexClass::class, $complexClassFactory);
        }
    }

    // test it out
    $obj = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(MyComplexClass::class);
    var_dump($obj->verification); // bool(true)

In the above code we delegate instantiation of the `MyComplexClass` class to a closure, `$complexClassFactory`. 
Once this delegation is made, the Injector will return the results of the specified closure when asked to instantiate 
`MyComplexClass`.

#### Available Delegate Types

Any valid PHP callable may be registered as a class instantiation delegate using `Qubus\Injector\Injector::delegate`. 
Additionally, you may specify the name of a delegate class that specifies an `__invoke` method, and it will be 
automatically provisioned and have its `__invoke` method called at delegation time. Instance methods from uninstantiated 
classes may also be specified using the `['NonStaticClassName', 'factoryMethod']` construction. For example: visiting:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    class SomeClassWithDelegatedInstantiation {
        public $value = 0;
    }
    
    class SomeFactoryDependency {}
    
    class MyFactory {
        private $dependency;
        function __construct(SomeFactoryDependency $dep) {
            $this->dependency = $dep;
        }
        function __invoke() {
            $obj = new SomeClassWithDelegatedInstantiation;
            $obj->value = 1;
            return $obj;
        }
        function factoryMethod() {
            $obj = new SomeClassWithDelegatedInstantiation;
            $obj->value = 2;
            return $obj;
        }
    }
    
    // Works because MyFactory specifies a magic __invoke method
    Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app()->delegate(SomeClassWithDelegatedInstantiation::class, MyFactory::class);
    $obj = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(SomeClassWithDelegatedInstantiation::class);
    var_dump($obj->value); // int(1)
    
    // This also works
    Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app()->delegate(SomeClassWithDelegatedInstantiation::class, 'MyFactory::factoryMethod');
    $obj = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(SomeClassWithDelegatedInstantiation::class);
    var_dump($obj->value); // int(2)

### Prepares and Setter Injection

Constructor injection is almost always preferable to setter injection. However, some APIs require additional 
post-instantiation mutations. The Injector accommodates these use cases with its `prepare()` method. 
Users may register any class or interface name for post-instantiation modification. Consider:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    
    class MyClass {
        public $myProperty = 0;
    }



    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;

    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use MyClass;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            $this->codefy->prepare(MyClass::class, function(int $myObj) {
                $myObj->myProperty = 42;
            });
        }
    }

    // test it works
    $myObj = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(MyClass::class);
    var_dump($myObj->myProperty); // int(42)

While the above example is contrived, the usefulness should be clear.

#### Injecting for Execution

In addition to provisioning class instances using constructors, the Injector can also recursively instantiate the 
parameters of any valid PHP callable. The following examples all work:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    $injector = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app();
    $injector->execute(function(){});
    $injector->execute([$objectInstance, 'methodName']);
    $injector->execute('globalFunctionName');
    $injector->execute('MyStaticClass::myStaticMethod');
    $injector->execute(['MyStaticClass', 'myStaticMethod']);
    $injector->execute(['MyChildStaticClass', 'parent::myStaticMethod']);
    $injector->execute('ClassThatHasMagicInvoke');
    $injector->execute($instanceOfClassThatHasMagicInvoke);
    $injector->execute('MyClass::myInstanceMethod');

Additionally, you can pass in the name of a class for a non-static method and the injector will automatically 
provision an instance of the class (subject to any definitions or shared instances already stored by the injector) 
before provisioning and invoking the specified method:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    class Dependency {}
    
    class AnotherDependency {}
    
    class Example {
        function __construct(Dependency $dep){}
        function myMethod(AnotherDependency $arg1, $arg2) {
            return $arg2;
        }
    }
    
    $injector = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app();
    
    // outputs: int(42)
    var_dump($injector->execute('Example::myMethod', $args = [':arg2' => 42]));

#### Dependency Resolution

The Injector resolves dependencies in the following order:

1. If a shared instance exists for the class in question, the shared instance will always be returned. 
2. If a delegate callable is assigned for a class, its return result will always be used. 
3. If a call-time definition is passed to `Qubus\Injector\Injector::make`, that definition will be used. 
4. If a pre-defined definition exists, it will be used. 
5. If a dependency is type-hinted, the Injector will recursively instantiate it subject to any implementations or definitions. 
6. If no type-hint exists and the parameter has a default value, the default value is injected. 
7. If a global parameter value is defined that value is used. 
8. Throw an exception because you did something stupid.

### Avoiding Evil Singletons

A common difficulty in web applications is limiting the number of database connection instances. It's wasteful and slow 
to open up new connections each time we need to talk to a database. Unfortunately, using singletons to limit these 
instances makes code brittle and hard to test. Let's see how we can use a service provider to inject the same PDO 
instance across the entire scope of our application.

Say we have a service class that requires two separate data mappers to persist information to a database:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);

    use PDO;
    use RecordNotFoundException;
    
    class HouseMapper {
        private $pdo;

        public function __construct(PDO $pdo) {
            $this->pdo = $pdo;
        }

        public function find($houseId) {
            $query = 'SELECT * FROM houses WHERE houseId = :houseId';
    
            $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare($query);
            $stmt->bindValue(':houseId', $houseId);
    
            $stmt->setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_CLASS, 'Model\\Entities\\House');
            $stmt->execute();
            $house = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_CLASS);
    
            if (false === $house) {
                throw new RecordNotFoundException(
                    'No houses exist for the specified ID'
                );
            }
    
            return $house;
        }
    
        // more data mapper methods here ...
    }
    
    class PersonMapper {
        private $pdo;
        public function __construct(PDO $pdo) {
            $this->pdo = $pdo;
        }
        // data mapper methods here
    }
    
    class SomeService {
        private $houseMapper;
        private $personMapper;
        public function __construct(HouseMapper $hm, PersonMapper $pm) {
            $this->houseMapper = $hm;
            $this->personMapper = $pm;
        }
        public function doSomething() {
            // do something with the mappers
        }
    }

In our wiring/bootstrap code, we simply instantiate the PDO instance once and share it in the context of the Injector:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;

    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use MyClass;
    use PDO;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        {
            $pdo = new PDO('sqlite:some_sqlite_file.sqlite');
            $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
            
            $this->codefy->share($pdo);
        }
    }

    // instantiate SomeService with the instantiated PDO instance
    $service = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(SomeService::class);

In the above code, the DIC instantiates our service class. More importantly, the data mapper classes it generates to do 
so are injected *with the same database connection instance we originally shared*.

Of course, we don't have to manually instantiate our `PDO` instance. We could just as easily seed the container with a 
definition for how to create the `PDO` object and let it handle things for us:

    <?php
    
    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\Infrastructure\Providers;
    
    use Codefy\Framework\Support\CodefyServiceProvider;
    use MyClass;
    use PDO;
    
    final class ExampleServiceProvider extends CodefyServiceProvider
    {
        public function register(): void
        { 
            $this->codefy->define(PDO::class, [
                ':dsn' => 'sqlite:some_sqlite_file.sqlite'
            ]);
    
            $this->codefy->share(PDO::class);
        }
    }
    
    // instantiate SomeService with the instantiated PDO instance
    $service = Codefy\Framework\Helpers\app(SomeService::class);

In the above code, the injector will pass the string definition as the $dsn argument in the `PDO::__construct` method 
and generate the shared `PDO` instance automatically only if one of the classes it instantiates requires a `PDO` instance!

## PSR-11 Container

Codefy includes a PSR-11 compatible container which extends the Injector. You can type-hint the PSR-11 container 
interface, and it will return an `Injector` instance.

    <?php
    
    return function (\Qubus\Routing\Psr7Router $router, Psr\Container\ContainerInterface $container) {
        $user = $container->get(App\Infrastructure\Services\UserAuth);
    
        //
    };
